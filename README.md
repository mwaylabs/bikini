# Relution LiveData

**Everything a model needs.**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mwaylabs/bikini.svg?branch=v0.5.2)](https://travis-ci.org/mwaylabs/bikini)

## What is Relution LiveData

**Relution LiveData** lets you treat  being **offline** as a status. Not as an error.

You're developing a webapp for mobile browsers? You're damn right here!

With Relution LiveData the user won't even notice that he is offline.
It also improves the user experience by decreasing response latency.

Another cool feature of Relution LiveData is that it keeps your app in sync. This allows you to build high collaborative apps by using [socket.io](http://socket.io/).

Relution LiveData is build on top of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) which gives your web application structure.

## How to use
Using Relution LiveData is set up using bower.

```
cd into your project
```

*install bikini via bower*, this will handle all dependencies for you and lets you easily update the library.
```
bower install -S bikini
```
add the libraries to your `.html` file
```html
<script src="bower_components/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/underscore/underscore.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/socket.io-client/socket.io.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/backbone/backbone.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/bikini/bikini.js"></script>
```

*now, let's set up the magic*

first, we need to define our Model and the according Collection
```js
// Configure the Model
// Attribute key to identify the data
var MyBikiniServiceModel = Bikini.Model.extend({
    idAttribute: '_id'
});

// Tell the collection the endpoint url and which model it should use.
// The entity is used for retrieving local stored data
var MyBikiniServiceCollection = Bikini.Collection.extend({
    model: MyBikiniServiceModel,
    entity: 'myBikiniService',
    url: 'http://nerds.mway.io:8200/bikini/contacts',
});
```


To fetch data, you can simply call the Backbonejs function fetch()
```js
var myCollection = new MyBikiniServiceCollection();
myBikiniServiceCollection.fetch();
```

You can listen to all the common Backbonejs events such as `sync`.
```js
myCollection.on('sync', function() {
    console.log(arguments);
});
```

### Event reference
See [backbonejs-events](http://backbonejs.org/#Events) for detailed information.

## Using Relution LiveData with AngularJS
You are building your application with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)? No problem.

```html
<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/underscore/underscore.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/socket.io-client/socket.io.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/backbone/backbone.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/bikini/dist/livedata.js"></script>
```

Just assign `Relution.LiveData.http = $http`. This causes the library to using Angulars `$http` to perform requests.

## Contributing

### Get the Code

```bash

git clone git@github.com:mwaylabs/bikini.git
cd bikini
```

### Initialize Project

The script basicly checks if node is installed. Then `npm install` and `bower install` is called followed by setup of git hooks.

```bash
./init-repo.sh
```
### Test if it works

run the test command

```bash
npm test
```

### Update Version

#### Update Versionnumber
 First of all update the version number in `package.json` and `bower.json`.

#### Generate build
 After changing sourcecode you have to update the build version of bikini. The production folder is called `dist` and contains 4 autogenerated files.
 To generate them run

 ```
 grunt dist
 ```
 This will generate a `dist/bikini.js` and an minified version of it as well an AngularJS wrapper called `dist/bikangular.js` and also an minified version of it.
 `grunt dist` will also update the wiki github pages.
#### Publish

 Generate a git tag for the current version number (bower update)

```
git tag -a vX.X.X -m vX.X.X
git push vX.X.X
```

then update the npm package

```
npm publish
```
